# Assignment 01

## A few WARNINGS

- For most of you, this is your first programming assignment - and even if
it's not, it's *extremely* likely that it *is* your first time to be
working in a command line environment. Because of this, you will likely
struggle mightily with this assignment, Budget your time wisely.

- You will likely be frustrated with some of the quirks of working in
Emacs. Even things most people these days consider to be easy tasks -
like copy and pasting - are going to require you to learn some new skills.
Persevere. It will get easier - **but only with practice**.

- You might be dismayed at the amount of text in the challenge
descriptions below. It's there for a reason. Skim at your peril.

- You don't have to do the challenges in the order presented. Please feel
free to cherry pick.


## How to check your work
If you want to check whether your code is *behaving as expected*, you can
run the command **make tests** from the directory of the challenge you're
working on.
> Just because the given tests run green does **not** mean everything is
fine - we've only included a handful of the test data we will use to
actually mark your assignments for correctness! You can add your own test
data to the csv files in the `tests/data` directory; just add additional
rows to the data already there.

If you want to see whether your code is *following the coding standards for
 this course*, you can run the command **make style** from the directory
of the challenge you're working on.
>  There is some overlap between the two tools used to do this task, so
you may notice some warnings are repeated between the two tools.  If you
don't understand any of the warnings (they **can** be a little opaque),
please talk to one of the IAs or your instructor.
