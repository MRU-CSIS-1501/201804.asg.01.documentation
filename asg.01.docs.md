# Assignment 01

## A few WARNINGS

- For most of you, this is your first programming assignment - and even if
  it's not, it's _extremely_ likely that it _is_ your first time to be
  working in a command line environment. Because of this, you will likely
  struggle mightily with this assignment, Budget your time wisely.

- You will likely be frustrated with some of the quirks of working in
  Emacs. Even things most people these days consider to be easy tasks -
  like copy and pasting - are going to require you to learn some new skills.
  Persevere. It will get easier - **but only with practice**.

- You might be dismayed at the amount of text in the challenge
  descriptions below. It's there for a reason. Skim at your peril.

- You don't have to do the challenges in the order presented. Please feel
  free to cherry pick.

## How to check your work

If you want to check whether your code is _behaving as expected_, you can
run the command **make tests** from the directory of the challenge you're
working on.

> Just because the given tests run green does **not** mean everything is
> fine - we've only included a handful of the test data we will use to
> actually mark your assignments for correctness! You can add your own test
> data to the csv files in the `tests/data` directory; just add additional
> rows to the data already there.

If you want to see whether your code is _following the coding standards for
this course_, you can run the command **make style** from the directory
of the challenge you're working on.

> There is some overlap between the two tools used to do this task, so
> you may notice some warnings are repeated between the two tools. If you
> don't understand any of the warnings (they **can** be a little opaque),
> please talk to one of the IAs or your instructor.
