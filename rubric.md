# Assignment 01 Rubric

Many ideas and wording are taken from the method of grading put forward in Harvard's CS50 course.

## The Formula

Challenge Score = (8 x Automated Correctness Checks) + (4 x Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis) + (8 x Design)

Assignment Score = average of challenge scores

## Cheezie Conglomerator Challenge

### Automated Correctness Checks

_"Does your code do what it was asked to do?"_

- [ ] 5: All tests pass.
- [ ] 4: At most 1 testing group fails.
- [ ] 3: At most 2 testing groups fail.
- [ ] 2: At least 1 testing group passes.
- [ ] 1: At least one test passes.
- [ ] 0: Code does not compile.

### Automated Style & Best Practice Analysis

_"How closely does your code follow the automated rules you are given?"_

- [ ] 5: No _true_ errors detected.
- [ ] 4: One **type** of _true_ error detected.
- [ ] 3: Two **types** of _true_ errors detected.
- [ ] 0: Three or more **types** of _true_ errors detected.

### Design

_"How closely does your code approach the design ideals of clarity, efficiency, and maintainability? How much care have you put into your work?"_

- [ ] 5: Excellent. Essentially no room for improvement.
- [ ] 4: Very good. Minor room for improvement.
- [ ] 3: Good. Some room for improvement.
- [ ] 2: Fair. Ample room for improvement.
- [ ] 1: Poor.
- [ ] 0: No attempt.
